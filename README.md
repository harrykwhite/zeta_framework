This is a presently incomplete framework for making 2D games in C using the OpenGL graphics API, incomplete mainly due to the lack of a proper audio implementation. My C programming skills have improved quite substantially since first starting this project earlier in 2024, and as such I am working on a completely new, separate version of it which will additionally feature audio support using OpenAL.
